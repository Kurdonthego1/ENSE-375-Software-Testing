## 1) Introduction

* This project is a console-based bank management application developed in Java, which is designed to primarily explore and integrate software testing methods. Although the major focus of this project is to implement testing techniques, this application will still consist of the basic core features such as account creation and ability to deposit and withdraw.

## 2) Design Problem

### 2.1 Problem Definition

* With the ever changing economic landscape, the safe and reliable management of your wealth has never been harder. Without a solution that allows users to manage their wealth and keep it secure, it puts stress and worry on them. This can lead to financial instability, unexpected debt, and difficulty achieving long-term financial goals. Our system will allow users to safely store, deposit, and withdraw and review their financial resources in an easy and reliable menu without too much complexity. 

### 2.2 Design Requirements

### 2.2.1 Functions

* Create new bank accounts with unique identifiers
* Deposit funds into user accounts
* Withdraw funds from user accounts
* Display account balances

### 2.2.2 Objectives

* App reliability
* Implementing local storage 
* User friendly with easy directions
* Easily testable and has no bugs

### 2.2.3 Contraints

* Budget constraints
* Team size
* Time constraints, project needs to be completed in 7 weeks
* Hardware and Software constraints
* Program must be created in Java, using Junit to test
* Testing using the V-Model

## 3) Solution

### 3.1 Solution 1
For our first solution, our idea was to stray towards making a GUI for our application using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript and or other Java frontend frameworks, while also focusing on implementing the main functionalities of our appplication. This includes:
* Ability to create different types of accounts.
* Depositing funds into accounts.
* Withdrawing funds from made accounts.
* Displaying account balances. 
* Abillity to delete own account.
With this solution, we would implement any of the big name databases such as MongoDB, or MySQL. When it comes to selecting a testing framework for this solution, we wanted to keep it minimal and stick with JUNit.

After considering all of these features in our application, we found that this solution would make testing and development more complex and serverly increase our development time, given our team only has a month to code and develop the main functionalities of our application. 
This solution would be prioritized over other alternatives if development time was not a primary constraint.

### 3.2 Solution 2
Our second solution would have the main functionalities of our first solution. However, this time instead of utilizing front-end languages/frameworks like HTML, CSS and Javascript for example, we would strictly limit our application to run using a console/terminal based GUI. 
Rather than using conventional database systems like MySQL or MongoDB, we would implement a local JSON-based storage solution, where data is persisted directly on the user's machine.
### 3.3 Final Solution
